-- This file contains strings that are (should be) specific to the application web site on top of RYC.
-- A duplicate of this file with more specific values (depends on your application) should be in the application project,
-- and will override this RYC file.

-- for naming variables, we use
--        "_" instead of "." to prevent problems in the JSP expression language (which interprets dots as path between objects).
--        and instead of "-" to prevent problems in the JSP EL (which try to calculate the expressions around -).
